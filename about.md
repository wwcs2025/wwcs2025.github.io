The Winter Workshop on Complex Systems is a week-long gathering that brings together young researchers from a wide variety of disciplines, coming from all corners of the globe, to delve into the intricate world of complexity science and collaborate on novel research projects. 

The workshop is grounded in several fundamental principles. Firstly, it aims to cultivate fresh scientific collaborations that span multiple disciplines, giving rise to innovative solutions to the most pressing issues related to complex systems. These collaborations often lead to subsequent publications in high-level scientific journals, like [Physical Review E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.052311), [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98147-w#Ack1), and [International Interactions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03050629.2021.1860034) are the result of collaborations initiated in previous editions of the Workshop. Secondly, invited speakers present state-of-the-art research in this area and offer mentorship during the workshop, ensuring that participants receive the highest quality guidance.

Another essential tenet of the Winter Workshop on Complex Systems is independence. This event was originally conceived by early-career researchers who sought to create a platform where young talented scientists could undertake research independently. This approach fosters creativity, curiosity, and a genuine passion for scientific inquiry. Diversity is also a cornerstone of the workshop. The selected participants come from an array of different backgrounds, ensuring a richness of ideas, perspectives, and experiences. Additionally, the workshop is affordable, with a low registration fee that makes it accessible to early-stage researchers who may have limited travel budgets. Financial support may be available to some candidates, further increasing the inclusivity of the workshop.

Finally, the workshop organizers aim to create a community whose links last well beyond the workshop's end. By fostering a collaborative and supportive environment, they hope to promote an enjoyable and fruitful experience for all participants.

The Winter Workshop on Complex Systems was first initiated by a small group of attendees at the [Santa Fe Institute Summer School on Complex Systems](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/programs/sfi-complex-systems-summer-school) in 2014. Since then, it has grown exponentially, attracting young researchers from all over the world, who are drawn to its high standards, diversity, and affordability. In fact, as a proof of this increasing recognition within the complexity science community, the WWCS was awarded the Service Award by the Complex Systems Society in 2022 ([Service Award](https://cssociety.org/event/c08452ce-9986-4bf7-8b33-cb72a9bb50c9)). This workshop is an exciting opportunity for young scientists to explore new research avenues, collaborate with others, and contribute to the development of complexity science.
