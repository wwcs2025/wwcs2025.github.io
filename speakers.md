[Luce Prignano](https://www.dribia.com/team/phd-luce-prignano/)

Dr. Luce Prignano is the project manager at NGO Heurística, overseeing research, scientific communication, and interdisciplinary educational projects. She maintains collaborations with a broad spectrum of academic institutions, NGOs, and public organizations.

Holding a PhD in Physics, Luce is currently affiliated with the Complex Systems Lab Barcelona (ClabB) and the University of Barcelona Institute of Complex Systems (UBICS). Her initial foray into transdisciplinary research was at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution (IPHES), where she learned to cooperate with professionals from diverse academic and scientific backgrounds.

Her research adopts methodologies from Statistical Physics, Complex Systems, and Network Science to analyze past societies and explore the dynamics of human interactions.

[Marta Sales Pardo](http://seeslab.info/researchers/sales-pardo/)

Marta Sales-Pardo obtained a PhD in Physics from Universitat de Barcelona. She did her postdoctoral work at Northwestern University, where she was the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and later she became a Research Assistant Professor at the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Science Institute with joint appointments in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems. In 2009 she moved to Universitat Rovira i Virgili where she is now a Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and coleads the SEES lab with Roger Guimerà.

In 2013 and 2021 she received an ICREA Acadèmia Award for her excellence in research. From 2019 until 2021 she was member of the Advisory Board of the McDonnell Foundation. Since 2021 she is a Fellow of the Network Science Society. Since July 2022 she is the president of the Catalan Complex Systems Society.

[Fariba Karimi](https://networkinequality.com/people/fariba-karimi/)

Fariba Karimi has been a team leader in computational social science at the CSH Vienna and an assistant professor at the Department of Network and Data Science at CEU since March 2021. Fariba received her PhD degree in physics and computational science from Umea University (Sweden) in 2015 and was a PostDoc at GESIS – Leibniz Institute for Social Sciences in Germany. Fariba’s research focuses on computational social science, the emergence of biases and inequality in networks and algorithms, and modeling human behavior. Her recent research revolves around the topics of visibility of minorities in social networks, the impact of network structure on ranking and recommender algorithms, and disparities in academia and its impact on under-represented groups. She combines statistical analyses of large datasets of online interactions with computational models, agent-based modeling, and network analysis. In 2022, Fariba together with a team of international researchers was awarded an EU Horizon grant to study multi-criteria fairness in AI systems.
