Please send us an email with a motivation (200 words) and a list of needed funds to our email address [wwcs2025@gmail.com](mailto:wwcs2025@gmail.com). With the acceptance letter, we will notify you with how much money we can support you. In case the required budget exceeds the available funds, we might not be able to cover all your needed costs.

Fundación Sicómoro offers 3 scholarships for applicants to the workshop. To be elegible to this scholarship, you must follow these steps: 

1.⁠ ⁠**Pre-register for the WWCS2025:** Fill out the general application form.

2.⁠ ⁠**Indicate interest in the scholarship:** While completing the application form, explicitly mention that you are applying for one of the three Fundación Sicómoro scholarships. Even though it is an Spanish foundation, all nationalities and languages are welcome to apply.

3.⁠ ⁠**Submit a motivation letter:** Attach a letter of motivation addressed to Fundación Sicómoro, explaining why you want to participate and why you should be awarded the scholarship. This letter of motivation should be a different letter to the cover letter for the workshop.
